Under construction.
I've always had an interest in how things work under the hood, and one thing that always bothered me as a web developer was not having a strong understanding of how the browser works. Sure, I understood that there was a browser engine, JS engine, and a bit about the DOM. But how does it _really_ work? A couple years ago I set out to teach myself what I never had before, and now I'd like to share some of that with you.
