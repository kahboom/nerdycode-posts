First and foremost, some key concepts:

## Materials

I got most of my things from KBDfans, and some other things were . They ship from China, but are pretty quick.. which isn't surprising because the shipping to the UK was a whopping Â£19, not including import fees. Anyway, here's what I ordered:

- Polycarbonate plate
- Rev 2 65% PCB with underglow
- 65% frosted acrylic case

I already had some keycaps and switches:

- Keycaps: Norbauer After School 1992
- Switches: NovelKey Creams

## Testing PCB

Then I just set it aside.

## Lubing Switches & Stabilizers

All in all, this took me about 

## Soldering

When it came to the soldering, I used a Hakko F.

## And Desoldering..

What an absolute pain in the ass..

## Assembling

## Re-Testing

## The Final Product

Typing test coming soon..
